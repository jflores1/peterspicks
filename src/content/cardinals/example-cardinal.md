Cardinal Example has served as the Archbishop of Example since 2010. Known for his diplomatic skills and theological expertise, he has been a close advisor to Pope Francis on matters of ecumenism.

He previously served as the Vatican's ambassador to France and is fluent in five languages. His moderate positions on various church issues have made him acceptable to both traditional and progressive factions within the College of Cardinals.
